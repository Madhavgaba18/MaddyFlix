# MaddyFlix Project

This project is a Netflix clone created as part of my journey to learn web development. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Axios, react-youtube-trailers, and react-router-dom.

# Features

Homepage: Mimics the layout of the Netflix homepage, displaying a collection of movies and TV shows.

Trailer Playback: Integrates react-youtube-trailers to play trailers of selected titles.

Responsive Design: Ensures the application is usable and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.

Routing: Utilizes react-router-dom for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different pages of
the application.

# Technologies Used

HTML: Markup language for structuring the web pages.

CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the web pages.

JavaScript: Programming language used for dynamic behavior and interactivity.

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making AJAX requests.

react-youtube-trailers: React component for playing YouTube trailers.

react-router-dom: Library for declarative routing in React applications.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
